# YouTube Video Opener
## Desc
When ran this will open a somewhat random YouTube video and the search results that provided this video. It's not entirely random because it's not a random 11 figure string in the "watch?v=" link place. Rather, it's a random video pulled from search results on 3 possible searches that are also somewhat randomized given a random string of numbers in the search.

## Requirements
